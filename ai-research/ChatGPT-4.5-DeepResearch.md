# Axum vs. Fermyon Spin: A Deep Comparison

## Overview of Axum and Fermyon Spin

**Axum** is a Rust web framework for building HTTP servers. It is built on the Tokio asynchronous runtime and Hyper HTTP library, emphasizing ergonomics and high performance through async/await concurrency. Axum applications compile to a native binary (which can be containerized with Docker) and run as always-on servers listening for requests.

**Fermyon Spin** is a framework and runtime for **serverless WebAssembly (WASM)** applications. You write your server logic as a WASM component (often in Rust, via the Spin SDK), and the Spin runtime executes these components on-demand in a **WASM sandbox**. Spin apps are event-driven (e.g. handling HTTP requests) and by default **do not run continuously** â€“ instead, Spin quickly instantiates a WASM module to handle each incoming request. Spin can be self-hosted or used on Fermyonâ€™s managed cloud, which provides a **scaling, on-demand environment** for running Spin components.

## Conclusion

Both Axum and Fermyon Spin are powerful in their domains, but they cater to different needs:

- **Axum** excels when you need a full-featured web server with maximum performance, control over the environment, and the ability to integrate with anything Rust can do natively.

- **Spin** shines for serverless and event-driven scenarios. It simplifies the development of scalable services by offloading the hard parts of scaling and isolation to the runtime.

**Which to choose?** It ultimately depends on your use case. For a long-running high-throughput API with complex logic, Axum might be quicker and easier to integrate today. If you want to â€œwrite once, run anywhereâ€ or have a true serverless deployment with Rust code (and you donâ€™t mind adopting newer tech), Spin offers a compelling model.

Both frameworks use Rustâ€™s strengths â€“ performance and safety â€“ but in different ways. Axum keeps you close to the metal (native execution, OS threads), while Spin abstracts the metal away (WASM sandbox, managed execution). By understanding their differences in concurrency, performance, and developer experience, you can make an informed decision suited to your projectâ€™s needs.

**References:**

- Axum is built on Tokio and Hyper, enabling async/await concurrency for high-traffic servers.
- Fermyon Spin runs serverless WebAssembly; the platform handles scaling and concurrency by spawning isolated instances per request.
- Performance notes: Spin can handle ~28k requests/sec with sub-millisecond startup latency per request on modest hardware.
- Spinâ€™s development model removes the need for multithreading in user code, simplifying development for serverless apps.
- Axum example of defining routes and running a server. Spin example of an HTTP component with response building.
